# Code-Quiz

## Application Description

A dynamic basic JavaScript quiz that will encourage the user to not only get the correct answer but to improve their recall speed.

## How it works

When the application is ran the user will be informed about the scoring and penalties for incorrect answers. When the user clicks the start button they will be asked a series of timed questions until either every question is answered or until the time has reached zero. After completing the quiz they will be given the opportunity to enter their initials and if the score is higher than the highscore they will claim the new highscore.
